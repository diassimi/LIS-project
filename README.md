# LIS-project

dynamic program that solves the longest increasing subsequence problem. 
A sequence S is a subsequence of another sequence T if you can produce S by removing some items from T (without reordering them). 
For instance, [0, 2, 5] is a subsequence of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,], but [5, 2, 0] is not. Your objective is to find the longest possible subsequence whose items are strictly increasing (that is if i < j then s i < s j ).
